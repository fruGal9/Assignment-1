    <p><strong>What are the three parts of an HTML element?</strong></p>
    <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.</p>
    <p><strong>6. What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?</strong></p>
    <p>The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
        This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.</p>
    <p><strong>7. What is the HTML element?</strong></p>
    <p>The HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the
        root element</p>
    <p><strong>8. What is the purpose of the head element?</strong></p>
    <p>The HEAD element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the HTML tag and the
        BODY tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define
        the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
    </p>
    <p><strong>9. What is the purpose of the body element?</strong></p>
    <p>The body tag defines the document's body. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as
        headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>10. How do you create a paragraph in HTML?</strong></p>
    <p>To add a new paragraph in HTML, place your insertion mark cursor into the HTML document where you want to add the
        new paragraph. Then type the paragraph start tag: p. Then type the paragraph's text. At the end of the new
        paragraph's text, type the end tag: p .</p>
    <p><strong>11. How do you create a heading in HTML?</strong></p>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the h tag.</p>
    <p><strong>12. How many different levels of headings are there and what is the difference between
            them?</strong></p>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags, h1 defines the most important heading, h6 defines the least
        important heading.</p>
    <p><strong>13. What element should you use to make text bold and important?</strong></p>
    <p>The Strong Importance element. The strong HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance,
        seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</p>
    <p><strong>14. What element should you use to make text italicized to add emphasis to it?</strong></p>
    <p>To italicize the text in HTML, use either the em tag or the i (italics) tag. Both of these tags will italicize
        the text, but the em tag additionally indicates that the text has stress emphasis when read.</p>
    <p><strong>15. What relationship does an element have with any nested elements within it?</strong></p>
    <p>When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them. The nested
        elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.</p>
    <p><strong>16. What relationship do two elements have if they are at the same level of nesting?</strong></p>
    <p>Two elements that are at the same level of nesting are siblings.</p>
    <p><strong>17. How do you create HTML comments?</strong></p>
    <p>An HTML comment can be added in VSCode using CTRL + / . HTML comments are visible to anyone that
        views the page source code, but are not rendered when the HTML document is rendered by a browser.</p>
    <p><strong>18. What HTML tag is used to create an unordered list?</strong></p>
    <p>The ul HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.</p>
    <p><strong>19. What HTML tag is used to create an ordered list?</strong></p>
    <p>The ol HTML element represents an ordered list of items â€” typically rendered as a numbered list</p>
    <p><strong>20. What HTML tag is used to create list items within both unordered and ordered lists?</strong></p>
    <p>Once we define list items with the li tag, the list appears in Web browsers in the bulleted form (by default). It
        is used inside both ordered and unordered list.</p>
    <p><strong>21. What element is used to create a link?</strong></p>
    <p>The a HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email
        addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
    <p><strong>22. What is an attribute?</strong></p>
    <p>HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.</p>
    <p><strong>23. What attribute tells links where to go?</strong></p>
    <p>The hypertext reference, or href , attribute is used to specify a target or destination for the anchor element.
        It is most commonly used to define a URL where the anchor element should link to.</p>
    <p><strong>24. What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?</strong></p>
    <p>An absolute URL contains more information than a relative URL does. Relative URLs are more convenient because
        they are shorter and often more portable. However, you can use them only to reference links on the same server
        as the page that contains them</p>
    <p><strong>25. Which element is used to display an image?</strong></p>
    <p>The img element serves two purposes: It describes the size and other attributes of the image and its presentation
    </p>
    <p><strong>26. What two attributes do images always need to have?</strong></p>
    <p>The img element has two required attributes: src : The source location (URL) of the image file. alt : The
        alternate text. This is used to describe the image for someone who cannot see it because they are either using a
        screen reader or the image src is missing.</p>
    <p><strong>27. How do you access a parent directory in a file path?</strong></p>
    <p>You can access the parent directory by using the following: ./example/example or ../example/example.</p>
    <p><strong>28. What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?</strong></p>
    <p>There are four main image file types that are most widely used online: JPG, PNG, GIF and SVG.</p>
